# Dog Jacket 

This website is a part of the project made for a competition at the University of Chester called - Hackathon. It's just an example of  how could look a design. The idea for the app was to control the LED lights on a jacket and allow us to change colour, show text or dog name or even some specific pattern. Unfortunately, we haven't been able to finish full functionality.
